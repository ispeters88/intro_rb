# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?

# A hash stores relationships between data value pairs, while an array stores individual data values
# "Individual" in this sense can still refer to a list of multiple items (even a hash can be an "individual data item")
# But for an array, each data item is standalone and not attached to another data item (unlike a hash)
